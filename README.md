A Hybrid Framework setup 
Maven project --> with Selenium java ---> BDD Framework + Gherkin language --> Junit for Test execution + Log4j2 for logging.

I have used a website name as SUITE CRM application --> its a demo website so data breaching is also possible make sure not to provide personal info
